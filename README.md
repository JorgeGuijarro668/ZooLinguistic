Voice Command Classifier with Real-Time Prediction

This is a real-time voice command recognition system that classifies animal names. Using Python, scikit-learn, and librosa, the system analyzes 540 voice recordings with MFCC-based feature extraction and deploys 10 classification models, including SVM, Random Forest, and KNN. Through advanced hyperparameter optimization and feature selection, the KNN model achieved 93.52% accuracy while reducing the feature set from 5,186 to 2,700. The project also includes a cross-platform interface built with Streamlit, providing a user-friendly environment for real-time voice predictions, making it a full-stack machine learning solution compatible with various operating systems.
